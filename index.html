  "about": "A circle is a 2 dimensional plane shape. Its measurable property is its diameter. Its radius is half of the diameter. Related shapes are sphere, cylinder and cone.",
	"abstract": "The area of a circle is defined by comparing it to a square since that is the base of area calculation. The circle can be cut into four quadrants, each placed with their origin on the vertices of a square. In this layout the arcs of the quadrants of an inscribed circle would meet at the midpoints of the sides of the square. The arcs of the quadrants of a circumscribed circle would meet at the center of the square. The arcs of the quadrants that equal in area to the square intersect right in between these limits on its centerlines. The ratio between the radius of the circle and the side of the square is calculable. The radius equals √(5) * side / 4. The quarter of the uncovered area in the middle equals (√3.2r)^2 ÷ 4 − ((90° − 2 × Atan(1 ÷ 2)) ÷ 360 × 3.2r^2 + 2(√(3.2)r ÷ 4 × √(3.2)r ÷ 2) ÷ 2)) . An overlapping area equals 2(Atan(1 ÷ 2) ÷ 360° × 3.2r^2 − (√(3.2)r ÷ 4 × √(3.2)r ÷ 2) ÷ 2) . Dividing both sides by 3.2r^2 : 1 ÷ 4−((90° − 2 × Atan(1 ÷ 2)) ÷ 360° + (1 ÷ 8)) = 2(Atan(1 ÷ 2) ÷ 360° − (1 ÷ 8) ÷ 2) . Simplifying further: 1 ÷ 4 − ((90° − 2 × Atan(1 ÷ 2)) ÷ 360°) = 2 × Atan(1 ÷ 2) ÷ 360° . Substituting 90° / 360° for 1 / 4: 90° ÷ 360° − ((90° − 2 × Atan(1 ÷ 2)) ÷ 360°)=2 × Atan(1 ÷ 2) ÷ 360° . Simplifying further: Atan(1÷2) = Atan(1÷2) . Which is equivalent to 1 = 1. When the arcs of the quadrant circles intersect at the quarter of the centerline of the square, the uncovered area in the middle equals exactly the sum of the overlapping areas respectively. The area of both the square and the sum of the quadrants equals 16 right triangles with legs of a quarter, and a half of the square's sides, and its hypotenuse equal to the radius of the circle. The area of the circle equals 4 * radius / √(5))^2 = 16 / 5 × r^2 .",

<summary><h3 style="margin:7px;">3. Fractions</h3></summary>
<br>
<br>
<p style="margin:12px;">Fractions are results of division, some are non-whole numbers.
<br>
<br>
E.g. the results of breaking a branch in half are 2 half branches.
<br>
<br>
A half is mathematically expressed as 1 / 2, or 0.5. In case of 1 / 2, 1 is the counter, 2 is the denominator.
<br>
<br>
It can be expressed as one over two.
<br>
<br>
Halving a half gives two quarter pieces... ( 1 / 2 ) / 2 = 1 / 4 = 0.25, and so on.
<br>
<br>
The numerals after the decimal point are called decimals.
<br>
I.e. 1 / 8 = 0.125. The decimals are 1 tenth ( 1 / 10 ), 2 hundredths ( 2 / 100 ) and 5 thousandths ( 5 / 1000 ).
<br>
<br>
Breaking the branch into 3 equal pieces gives 1 / 3. 
<br>
That could be written in decimal form only with an infinite number of numerals.

<summary><h3 style="margin:7px;">4. Powers</h3></summary>
<br>
<br>
<p style="margin:12px;">Raising a number or unit of measurement to a power means multiplying it by itself.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Example #1: 
<br>
<br>
Raising to the 3rd power means multiplying the number by itself twice.
<br>
<br>
2³ = 2^3 = 2 × 2 × 2 = 8
<br>
<br>
<br>
Example #2: 
<br>
<br>
Raising to the -4th power means the reciprocal of the 4th power. 
<br>
<br>
3^(-4) = 1 / 3⁴ = 1 / ( 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 ) = 1 / 81
<br>
<br>
<br>
Example #3: 
<br>
<br>
The result of raising to a fraction is a root. 
<br>
<br>
4^(1 / 2) = √4 = 2

<h2 style="margin:7px">The 2nd and the 3rd power manifesting in geometry</h2>
<br>
<br>
<p style="margin:12px;"> Setting the square and the cube as the basis of the area and the volume calculation is well established and straightforward. Regardless of the shape of the measured object, the unit of measurement of the area is square units and the volume can be expressed in cubic units.

<p style="margin:12px;">A cuboid is a 3 dimensional solid shape. Its measurable properties are width, length and height. The volume of a cuboid is a simple multiplication of the edges, width × length × height. The cubic root of the product of the edges is the edge length of the theoretical cube that has the same volume as the cuboid.

<p style="margin:12px;">The area of a triangle equals exactly the half of the area of a rectangle with a width equal to the base of the triangle and length equal to the height of the triangle.
<br>
<br>
The base of a triangle multiplied by its height equals to a rectangle with an area exactly the double of the triangle. 
<br>
<br>
The square root of half of the area of the rectangle is the side length of the theoretical square that has the same area as the triangle.

  <summary><h4 style="margin:7px">While the approximate value of 3.14159…, commonly denoted by the Greek letter π, is widely recognized today, the historical development of this concept is less understood.</h4></summary>
<p style="margin:12px;">
For centuries, the circle has been a symbol of mathematical elegance—and π its most iconic constant. But beneath the surface of tradition lies a deeper question: Are the formulas we use truly derived from geometric logic, or are they inherited approximations dressed in symbolic authority?
<br>
<br>
The constant relationship between a circle's circumference and its diameter has captivated mathematicians for millennia.
Ancient civilizations grappled with this geometric challenge, employing various methods to approximate this ratio. They deserve credit for their mathematical ingenuity. But the fact that these methods were developed thousands of years ago should not shield them from scrutiny.
<br>
<br>
The verse of 1. Kings 7:23 in the Holy Bible suggests that some estimated it as 3. 
<br>
<br>
Historical records suggest that ancient Babylonians initially calculated it as 3, later they used 3.125; Egyptians estimated it as ( 16 / 9 )² ~ 3.16.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<section>
<h4 style="margin:12px;">Archimedes and the Polygonal Trap</h4>
<br>
<br>
<p style="margin:12px;">The Greek Archimedes’ method for estimating the π is often celebrated as a foundational triumph of geometric reasoning.
<br>
<br>
But that method contains critical flaws.
<br>
<br>
Archimedes approximated the circle using inscribed and circumscribed polygons. He began with a circle bounded by an inscribed and a circumscribed hexagon — not the absolute minimum of 3 or 4 sides — likely because the hexagon is closer to the circle while still being easily calculable. He then increased the number of sides to 96, observing how the difference between the two polygonal perimeters — one inside the circle, one outside — became smaller. 
<br>
This narrowing gap was key. Archimedes likely believed that as the number of sides increased, the difference between the perimeters of the inscribed and circumscribed polygons would converge toward zero, approaching the circumference of the circle.
<br>
He assumed that more sides mean closer resemblance to a circle. That was backed by the isoperimetric inequality theory, which states that a circle maximizes area for a given perimeter. That idea likely emerged from observing simple polygons: the triangle has the smallest area, the square is larger, and so on. From this pattern, it was assumed that the trend continues indefinitely — that a polygon with an infinite number of sides would resemble a circle perfectly, with its area approaching from below.
<br>
<br>
But that assumption ignores a crucial geometric reality: as the number of sides increases, the internal angles of the polygon approach 180° — it is 180° - 360° / 96 = 176.25° in the case of a 96-gon —, nearing a straight line rather than a curve. In contrast, polygons with internal angles in the range between 150° and 160°, such as the 13- to 16-gon, preserve a meaningful bend that better reflects circularity.
<br>
<br>
Archimedes pushed his method far beyond this curve-aligned threshold — and the result was a recursive underestimate. The perimeter of the circumscribed polygon that he believed to be an overestimate of the circumference was practically an underestimate of it. 
<br>
<br>
Thus his final result of 3.14... lies between two underestimates. The method itself introduced compounding errors. These include:
<br>
<br>
- Misapplied isoperimetric logic beyond its valid range
<br>
<br>
- Possible inaccuracies in calculating the properties of the 96-gon via angle bisecton
<br>
<br>
- Rounding errors of infinite fractions, amplified over 96 iterations 
<br>
<br>
What we’re left with is not a proof, but a layered approximation — one that has shaped centuries of geometry, but now deserves a closer, more rational reexamination.
<br>
<br>
Similarly, the area formula A = πr² is not a direct result of calculus. It’s reverse-engineered by multiplying the circumference formula C = 2πr by half the radius—treating the area as the sum of infinitesimal rings. While the method is algebraically valid, it bypasses the geometric logic that defines area: the comparison to a square.

<h4 style="margin:12px;">The Symbol π: A Linguistic Shortcut</h4>
<br>
<br>
<p style="margin:12px;">The symbol π was introduced because the estimate ratio—approximately 3.14159…—is an infinite fraction. Since we can’t write all its digits, we needed a symbol. But this symbol has taken on a life of its own.
<br>
<br>
Technically, the circumference is a perimeter. So the ratio ( P / d ) ( perimeter over diameter ) became π / δ in Greek. With ( d = 1 ), we get ( π / 1 = π ). 
<br>
But this is not necessarily the ratio itself—it’s the notation of that ratio. That distinction matters. There was a ratio between circumference and diameter long before the Greeks studied it. We must not let their symbolic shortcut overwrite a more fundamental geometric truth.
<br>
<br>
It was not until the 18th century that the symbol π, popularized by the mathematicians of the time, gained widespread acceptance. 
</p>
</section>
<br>
<br>
<section>
<h4 style="margin:12px;">∫ Calculus: Summary, Not Source</h4>
<br>
<br>
<p style="margin:12px;">Several complex formulas were introduced by different mathematicians, aimed at more accurately estimating this ratio, based on a theoretical polygon with an infinite number of sides. 
<br>
<br>
All of the above mentioned approximation methods have two things in common: 
<br>
<br>
- They assume that the circle maximizes the area with a given perimeter, and
<br>
<br>
- they estimate the perimeters of polygons and do not account for the curved shape of the circle.
<br>
<br>
Modern calculus summarizes these approximations with elegant notation, such as:
</p>
<br>
<math style="margin:12px;" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block">
  <mrow>
    <mi>C</mi>
    <mo>=</mo>
    <msubsup>
      <mo>&#x222B;</mo> <!-- Integral symbol -->
      <mn>0</mn>
      <mrow>
        <mn>2</mn>
        <mi>&#x03C0;</mi> <!-- pi -->

    <mi>r</mi>
    <mo>&#x2062;</mo> <!-- Invisible times -->
    <mi>d</mi>
    <mi>&#x03B8;</mi> <!-- theta -->
  </mrow>
</math>
<br>
<p style="margin:12px;">
But this is not a magical formula—it’s a symbolic summary of prior assumptions. Each notation should correspond to a real, logical property of the circle. Yet upon inspection, inconsistencies emerge. The formula doesn’t derive the circumference from first principles; it assumes it. 
<br>
<br>
Calculus can be a useful mathematical tool, but calling it exact is a bold statement. 
<br>
<br>
It can be exact with exact limits and basic operations, but if those are given then they can be calculated directly without calculus.

<h4 style="margin:12px;">φ The Golden Ratio</h4>
<br>

<p style="margin:12px;">Some relate the numeric value of 3.14… to the so-called “golden ratio” of ( √5 + 1 ) / 2.

</math>
<br>
<p style="margin:12px;">This equation has no logical ties to the area nor the circumference of a circle.
<br>
<br>
The golden ratio of ( √5 + 1 ) / 2 is irrelevant to the definition of these properties.

<h4 style="margin:12px;">A Rational Alternative: 3.2</h4>
<br>
<br>
<p style="margin:12px;">Historical records suggest that a legislative process took place in 1897, Indiana, USA, known as House Bill 246 ( sometimes listed as 264 ), or Indiana Pi Act, aiming to replace the numeric value 3.14 by 3.2.
<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, the exact details of the proposed method in the Indiana Pi Bill are somewhat obscure and have been interpreted differently by various accounts. 
<br>
<br>
The π has served its symbolic purpose. But in geometry, clarity matters more than tradition. 
<br>
The π is a fundamental constant in the geometry of idealized circles and plays a crucial role in many mathematical theories. 
<br>
<br>
However, using geometric construction and algebraic simplification we find that when we move from these idealizations to the measurement of real objects, a slightly different constant, 3.2 emerges as more relevant for accurately describing their properties. 
<br>
By focusing on area relationships and direct comparisons between shapes, these methods emphasize a more intuitive and potentially more fundamental understanding of geometric concepts.
<br>
These values are exact, rational, and logically derived. They can be verified numerically, but more importantly, they can be proven algebraically—without relying on infinite fractions, symbolic shortcuts, or flawed assumptions.
<br>
<br>
Since the true ratio is exactly 3.2, and that is a rational number, then we can—and should—write it as it is. Let the π remain in the history books. Geometry deserves better.
<br>
<br>
That makes the arc value of 360° = 6.4radian, and trigonometric functions that rely on arc value have to be aligned to 3.2 respectively.
<br>
<br>
These are two aspects of that.

  <summary><h4 style="margin:7px">The " V = 4 / 3 × π × radius³ " formula is widely used for the volume of a sphere.</h4></summary>
<p style="margin:12px;">It is a cornerstone of theoretical geometry. 
<br>
<br>
It was estimated by comparing a hemisphere to the difference between the approximate volume a cone and a circumscribed cylinder.
<br>
<br>
However, my work focuses on the actual volume of physical spheres as determined through direct measurement. 
<br>
<br>
My calculations and experiments have consistently indicated a different relationship, expressed by the formula V = cubic value of ( √( 3.2 ) × radius ), which provides a more accurate result when dealing with real, physical entities. 
<br>
This formula isn't based on abstract geometric ideals alone but on tangible experiments where I've measured the volume of real spheres. 
<br>
<br>
These measurements have shown a systematic difference compared to the theoretical predictions based on the traditional formula, suggesting that the way we mathematically describe the volume of a sphere might need to be reconsidered when applied to physical objects. 
<br>
<br>
The " 4 / 3 × π × radius³ " formula is a very rough underestimate. 
<br>
<br>
If you're trying to calculate the volume of a physical ball or sphere for a practical purpose – whether it's for a science experiment, engineering, or any other real-world application – my empirically derived V = cubic value of ( √( 3.2 ) × radius ) formula offers a result that aligns more closely with what you would measure in the lab.

<h3 style="margin:12px;">The other idea is the cube dissection.</h3>
<br>
<div class="imgbox">
    <img class="center-fit" src="cubeDissection.jpeg" alt="Cube-dissection">
</div>
<br>
<p style="margin:12px;">A common method aiming to prove the pyramid volume formula ( V = base × height / 3 ) involves dissecting a cube into three pyramids. Here’s how it’s typically presented:
<br>
<br>
Take a cube with an edge length of ( e ).
<br>
<br>
Volume of the cube: V = the cubic value of e.
<br>
<br>
Imagine dividing the cube into three square pyramids, each with:
<br>
<br>
- Base: One face of the cube, so the base area is the square value of e .
<br>
<br>
- Height: The edge of the cube, ( e ), since the apex of each pyramid is the cube’s vertex opposite the base, depending on the dissection. 
<br>
<br>
A common dissection:
<br>
<br>
Choose one vertex of the cube as the apex.
<br>
<br>
Form three pyramids, each with this apex and a base on one of the three faces adjacent to that vertex.
<br>
<br>
Each pyramid has a base area of the square value of e, and height ( e ) (the distance from the apex to the base plane). 
<br>
<br>
Volume of each pyramid: V(pyramid) = ( square value of e ) × e, divided by 3 = the cubic value of e divided by 3.
<br>
<br>
Since there are three pyramids, their total volume is: 3 × ( ( cubic value of e ) divided by 3 ) = the cubic value of e.
<br>
<br>
This equals the cube’s volume, suggesting the one third factor is correct.
<br>
<br>
The Vertex Problem is a critical flaw in this dissection when applied to a real, physical cube:
<br>
<br>
Vertex Assignment: 
<br>
<br>
When we cut the cube into three pyramids sharing a common vertex as the apex, the geometry seems clean in theory. But if you physically slice the cube, you have to decide where that vertex belongs:
<br>
<br>
The cube has 8 vertices, each pyramid has 5. Three pyramids have 3 × 5 = 15 in total.
<br>
<br>
Each vertex is a point that can't be split into 3 points. The other way around, 3 points can't be merged into 1 without distortion. 
<br>
If we dissect the cube, we need to designate each shared vertex to be a part of either one pyramid, or another. 
<br>
<br>
Consequence: 
<br>
<br>
The volume of each pyramid is exactly a third of the cube, but with a base smaller than the square value of e, and height shorter than e.
<br>
<br>
Their bases and heights are slightly adjusted due to the vertex assignment, undermining the proof’s simplicity.
<br>
<br>
<br>
If the solid pyramids'
<br>
<br>
- base is the square value of e,
<br>
<br>
and their 
<br>
<br>
- height is e,
<br>
<br>
then the volume of each pyramid has to be larger than 1 / 3 × base × height, because 3 such pyramids can't form a cube with the same edge length, because their vertices and faces can't occupy the same space simultaneously.
<br>
<br>
The vertices are the most obvious examples, but the same is true for the edges, the diagonals and the inner faces. 
<br>
<br>
Applied correctly, the cube dissection proves that the volume of a cone or a pyramid has to be larger than base × height / 3.
<br>
<br>
The fact that the vertices of the 3 pyramids can't be merged into a single point without distortion proves that the so-called "calculus-based proofs" of the conventional formula are invalid. 
<br>
Also it's not just about the vertices, but the edges and the inner faces, too.
<br>
<br>
While 1 / 3 is a reasonable approximation, the exact ratio is 1 / √8.</p>
